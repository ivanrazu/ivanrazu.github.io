Currrently I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Laboratory for Systems Biology [Laboratory for Systems Biology](https://systemsmedicine.pulmonary.medicine.ufl.edu/)
 at University of Florida, working under the supervision of [Dr. Luis Sordo-Vieira](https://directory.ufhealth.org/sordo-vieira-luis).
 
I am originally from Costa Rica where I completed my undergraduate studies in Mathematics at [Universidad de Costa Rica](https://www.ucr.ac.cr/). I completed a Masters in Mathematics at [East Tennessee State University](http://www.etsu.edu/ehome/) under the direction of [Dr. Ariel Cintron-Arias](http://faculty.etsu.edu/cintronarias/).  Later, I obtained my PhD in Mathematics at [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.mathematics.pitt.edu/) where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Jonathan Rubin](https://www.mathematics.pitt.edu/people/jonathan-rubin) and [Dr. David Swigon](https://www.mathematics.pitt.edu/people/david-swigon) and in closed collaboration with [Dr. Gilles Clermont](https://mirm-pitt.net/staff/gilles-clermont-md/). More recently, I completed a postdoctoral training position  at [University of Tennessee Health Science Center](https://www.uthsc.edu/) in the Department of Pediatrics where I worked in the Laboratory of [Dr. Amber Smith](https://ambersmithlab.com/). 

I specialize in developing mathematical models—both theoretical and data-driven—to elucidate the intricate dynamics of pathogenic infections. My primary focus is on understanding the interplay between cellular metabolism, energy production, and consumption during infections, investigating whether disruptions in energy availability contribute to systemic inflammation and sepsis. Additionally, I am interested in data and statistical analysis within the public health and the biomedical field. My approach involves leveraging machine learning tools to extract pertinent information and used this information to develop probabilistic or deterministic mathematical models to test and create new hypothesis. 

More generally, I am interested in using mathematical tools to study the underlying dynamics of problems arising from immunology, oncology, epidemiology, population dynamics, infectious diseases, and many other areas of the life sciences.
