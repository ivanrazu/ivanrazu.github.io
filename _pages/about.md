I am originally from Costa Rica where I completed my undergraduate studies in Mathematics at [Universidad de Costa Rica](https://www.ucr.ac.cr/). I completed a Masters in Mathematics at [East Tennessee State University](http://www.etsu.edu/ehome/) under the direction of [Dr. Ariel Cintron-Arias](http://faculty.etsu.edu/cintronarias/).  Later, I obtained my PhD in Mathematics at [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.mathematics.pitt.edu/) where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Jonathan Rubin](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~rubin/) and [Dr. David Swigon](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~swigon/) and in closed collaboration with [Dr. Gilles Clermont](http://www.ccm.pitt.edu/directory/profile/gilles-clermont).  More recently, I completed a postdoctoral training position  at [University of Tennessee Health Science Center](https://www.uthsc.edu/) in the Department of Pediatrics where I worked in the Laboratory of [Dr. Amber Smith](https://ambersmithlab.com/). 

My area of reserach focuses on developing mathematical models (theoretical or data-driven) to extract important information about the complex dynamics that occur during a pathogenic infection. I am particularly interested in understanding the role of cellular metabolism, energy production and consumption during an infection. And whether poor energy availability or production is responsible for systemic inflammation that leads to sepsis. More generally, I am interested in using mathematical models to study the underlying dynamics of problems arising from immunology, oncology, epidemiology, population dynamics, infectious diseases, and many other areas of the life sciences.
