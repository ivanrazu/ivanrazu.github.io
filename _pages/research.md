I am an applied mathematician specializing in the use of mathematical tools to investigate biological
problems. My primary line of research focuses in understanding the intricate relationship
between immunometabolism and its implications in infectious diseases and inflammation using
applied analysis and dynamical systems. More generally, I am interested in developing data-driven
mechanistic models for understanding the underlying biology of specific biological processes including
the dynamics of infectious diseases in populations and in hosts. When the complexity of
the model allows it, I use dynamical systems theory and applied analysis techniques including parameter
bifurcation to extract important information about the problem. In most cases however,
these models cannot be solved analytically and it is necessary the use of existent or own written
numerical packages. Analytic or numerical analysis of the model can reveal rich insights about
the biology of the problem that would allow us to address relevant biological questions as well as
generate and test new hypothesis. I am also interested in using statistical methods and machine
learning algorithms to understand data patterns in clinical or experimental data, which can later
inform the development of mathematical models to comprehend underlying biological mechanisms
and generate/test hypotheses to be validated through further experiments. 

## Projects

### Mathematical Modeling of Energy Consumption in the Acute Inflammatory Response.

* Several studies have found a relation between sepsis and low levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) combined with overproduction of lactate and nitric oxide (NO). In this project we developed a system of ordinary differential equations to study the dynamics of the acute inflammatory response and its interactions with the production and demand of ATP. 
We also explored some altered metabolic states such as hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and hypoxia in the presence of sepsis obtaining consistent resuts with the literture.

### A Data-driven Mathematical Study of the Role of Energy in Sepsis.

* Building up on our previous model, we developed a mathematical model to determine main diferences across survivors and non-survivors on a sepsis study done on thirty-two  baboons. We identified parameters that help to predict survival outcomes and also highlights energy dependent factors that modulate the immune response.
